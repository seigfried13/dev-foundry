════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
🎯 SWEBENCH BENCHMARK CONTEXT
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

You are solving a real-world bug from a popular open-source repository as part
of **SWEBench-Verified**, a rigorous AI benchmark for evaluating code generation
and bug-fixing capabilities.

**SWEBench Rules (MANDATORY):**
1. 🚨 **NO TEST FILE MODIFICATIONS** - You fix the SOURCE CODE to pass EXISTING tests
2. 🚨 **PATCH MUST APPLY CLEANLY** - Use `git apply` to validate before submitting
3. 🚨 **ALL TESTS MUST PASS** - No regression allowed
4. 🚨 **MINIMAL CHANGES ONLY** - Only fix what's broken, nothing more

**Success Criteria:**
- Patch applies to base commit without errors
- All existing tests pass (100% pass rate)
- Original issue is completely resolved
- No test files modified
- No unrelated changes included

**Your Mission:**
Solve this verified real-world bug with production-quality code that would
be acceptable in the actual open-source project. Be thorough, be precise,
and validate everything before submitting.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PHASE 3 WORKFLOW: COMPREHENSIVE TESTING
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**STEP 0: EXTRACT YOUR APPROACH TICKET AND MAIN ISSUE TICKET**

```python
# Extract approach ticket ID from task description
approach_ticket_id = "[extract TICKET: xxx from task description]"

# Get the approach ticket
approach_ticket = mcp__hephaestus__get_ticket(approach_ticket_id)

# Get parent issue ticket (main issue)
main_issue_ticket_id = approach_ticket["parent_ticket_id"]
```

**STEP 1: RUN FULL TEST SUITE**

Run the COMPLETE test suite (not just reproduction test):

```python
# Add comment documenting test execution
mcp__hephaestus__add_ticket_comment({
    "ticket_id": approach_ticket_id,
    "agent_id": "[YOUR ACTUAL AGENT ID]",
    "comment_text": "Starting comprehensive test suite. Running all tests to verify no regression..."
})

# Run the full test suite
# Document EVERYTHING:
# - Test commands used
# - Full output
# - Pass/fail count
# - Any failures or errors
```

**STEP 2: ANALYZE TEST RESULTS**

Check:
- ✅ All existing tests pass (NO REGRESSION)
- ✅ Tests specific to the issue pass
- ✅ Reproduction test passes
- ✅ No new failures introduced

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PATH A: ALL TESTS PASS → SUCCESS! ✅
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**STEP 3A: GENERATE GIT PATCH AND REPRODUCTION INSTRUCTIONS**

🚨🚨🚨 CRITICAL: VERIFY NO TEST FILES IN PATCH! 🚨🚨🚨
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Before generating the final patch, VERIFY you haven't modified test files:

```bash
# Check git status for any modified test files
git status | grep -E "(test_|_test\.py|tests/|test/)"

# If ANY test files are modified, this is INVALID!
# You must revert them IMMEDIATELY:
git checkout -- tests/
git checkout -- test/
git checkout -- *test*.py

# ONLY source code changes are allowed!
```

**WHY THIS IS CRITICAL:**
Your solution will be REJECTED if it modifies test files. Solutions are evaluated
by running the ORIGINAL test suite. Modifying tests = INVALID SOLUTION.
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Generate the artifacts needed for independent validation:

```bash
# 1. Generate clean git diff patch
git diff > solution.patch

# 2. CRITICAL: Verify patch contains NO test file changes
if grep -E "(test_|_test\.py|/tests/|/test/)" solution.patch; then
    echo "🚨 ERROR: Patch contains test file modifications!"
    echo "This is FORBIDDEN. Revert test changes immediately."
    exit 1
fi

# 3. Verify patch is not empty
if [ ! -s solution.patch ]; then
    echo "ERROR: solution.patch is empty!"
    exit 1
fi

echo "✅ Patch verified: no test files modified"
```

🚨🚨🚨 CRITICAL NEW STEP: VERIFY PATCH ACTUALLY WORKS! 🚨🚨🚨
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**YOU MUST VERIFY THE PATCH APPLIES AND WORKS BEFORE SUBMITTING!**

This is the MOST IMPORTANT step - many patches look valid but fail when applied!

```bash
echo "🧪 CRITICAL: Testing that patch actually works..."

# Save current changes in a temporary commit
git add -A
git commit -m "WIP: temporary save before patch test"

# Reset to clean state (like validator will have)
git reset --hard HEAD^

# Try to apply the patch
echo "📋 Attempting to apply patch..."
if ! git apply solution.patch; then
    echo "🚨 FATAL ERROR: Patch does NOT apply cleanly!"
    echo "This patch will be REJECTED by validators!"
    echo "You must fix the patch before submitting!"
    exit 1
fi

echo "✅ Patch applied successfully"

# Now RE-RUN THE TESTS with the applied patch to make SURE it still works!
echo "🧪 Re-running tests with applied patch to verify it works..."
[RUN YOUR TEST COMMAND HERE - e.g., pytest, python -m pytest, etc.]

# If tests pass, you're good!
echo "✅ PATCH VALIDATION COMPLETE: Patch applies cleanly AND all tests pass!"

# Restore your work (go back to your original state)
git reset --hard
git checkout HEAD@{1}  # Go back to your WIP commit

# Keep the validated solution.patch file
echo "✅ Patch is VALIDATED and ready for submission!"
```

**WHY THIS IS CRITICAL:**

- Many patches include paths, line numbers, or contexts that break when applied fresh
- Validators will apply your patch to a clean repo - if it fails, INSTANT REJECTION
- This step simulates EXACTLY what validators will do
- If patch doesn't apply or tests fail after applying, FIX IT NOW!

**IF PATCH FAILS TO APPLY:**
1. Check for whitespace issues (tabs vs spaces)
2. Verify paths are correct (relative to repo root)
3. Ensure context lines match the base commit
4. Try regenerating with `git diff --no-prefix > solution.patch` or `git format-patch`

**IF TESTS FAIL AFTER APPLYING PATCH:**
1. Something is wrong with your changes
2. Debug and fix before submitting
3. NEVER submit a patch that doesn't work when applied!

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Now create reproduction_instructions.md for the validator:

```markdown
# How to Reproduce the Original Issue

This file guides the validation agent through reproducing and verifying the fix.

## Environment Setup
[Describe any setup needed - dependencies, config files, environment variables]

## Reproduction Steps (BEFORE applying patch)

1. [Step 1 to reproduce the bug - be specific with commands]
2. [Step 2 to reproduce the bug]
3. [What you should see - the buggy behavior]

Example:
```bash
python reproduce_issue.py
# Expected output: Error or incorrect behavior
```

## Test Cases to Verify Fix (AFTER applying patch)

### Test Case 1: Primary Issue from Problem Statement
```bash
[Exact command to run]
```
**Expected Result:** [What should happen after fix]

### Test Case 2: Edge Case A
```bash
[Exact command to test edge case]
```
**Expected Result:** [What should happen]

### Test Case 3: Edge Case B
```bash
[Exact command to test another edge case]
```
**Expected Result:** [What should happen]

## Running Full Test Suite

```bash
# Command to run project's complete test suite
[e.g., pytest, python -m unittest, npm test, etc.]
```

All tests should pass after applying the patch. No regression should occur.

## Files Modified

- [file1.py]: [Brief description of changes]
- [file2.py]: [Brief description of changes]
```

**STEP 4A: CREATE SOLUTION SUBMISSION MARKDOWN**

Create a comprehensive solution_submission.md:

```markdown
# Solution Report

## 1. Problem Summary
[Brief description of the issue from PROBLEM_STATEMENT.md]

## 2. Solution Overview
**Approach Used:** [Which approach ticket succeeded]
**Files Modified:**
- [file1]: [what was changed]
- [file2]: [what was changed]

**Why This Works:**
[Explanation of how the fix solves the problem]

## 3. Test Results
\`\`\`
[FULL test suite output showing all tests passing]

Total Tests: X
Passed: X
Failed: 0
\`\`\`

## 4. Reproduction Evidence

**Before (Bug):**
\`\`\`
[Output from reproduction script showing the bug]
\`\`\`

**After (Fixed):**
\`\`\`
[Output from reproduction script showing it works now]
\`\`\`

## 5. Code Quality Checks
- Linting: ✅ Clean (or provide output)
- Type checking: ✅ Clean (or provide output)

## 6. Git Patch
\`\`\`patch
[COMPLETE git diff patch that can be applied with git apply]
\`\`\`
```

**STEP 5A: RESOLVE APPROACH TICKET**

```python
mcp__hephaestus__resolve_ticket({
    "ticket_id": approach_ticket_id,
    "agent_id": "[YOUR ACTUAL AGENT ID]",
    "resolution_comment": (
        "✅ APPROACH SUCCESSFUL - Solution complete!\\n"
        "\\n"
        "**Test Results:**\\n"
        f"- Total tests: {total_tests}\\n"
        f"- Passed: {passed_tests}\\n"
        f"- Failed: 0\\n"
        "\\n"
        "**Verification:**\\n"
        "- ✅ All existing tests pass (no regression)\\n"
        "- ✅ Reproduction test passes\\n"
        "- ✅ Issue requirements met\\n"
        "- ✅ Code quality checks pass\\n"
        "- ✅ Git patch generated\\n"
        "\\n"
        "See solution_submission.md for complete details."
    )
})
```

**STEP 6A: RESOLVE MAIN ISSUE TICKET**

```python
mcp__hephaestus__resolve_ticket({
    "ticket_id": main_issue_ticket_id,
    "agent_id": "[YOUR ACTUAL AGENT ID]",
    "resolution_comment": (
        f"✅ ISSUE SOLVED via approach {approach_ticket_id}!\\n"
        "\\n"
        "**Solution Summary:**\\n"
        "[Brief description of fix]\\n"
        "\\n"
        "**Files Modified:**\\n"
        f"- {files}\\n"
        "\\n"
        "All tests passing. Submitting result."
    ),
    "commit_sha": "[git commit SHA if available]"
})
```

**STEP 7A: SUBMIT RESULT WITH EXTRA FILES**

```python
mcp__hephaestus__submit_result({
    "markdown_file_path": "./solution_submission.md",
    "agent_id": "[YOUR ACTUAL AGENT ID]",
    "explanation": "Issue solved. All tests pass, no regression. Patch ready for submission.",
    "evidence": [
        "Full test suite passes (X/X tests)",
        "Reproduction case now works correctly",
        "Git patch generated and validated",
        "Code quality checks pass"
    ],
    "extra_files": [
        "./solution.patch",
        "./reproduction_instructions.md"
    ]  # NEW: Include patch and reproduction guide for independent validation
})
```

**STEP 8A: MARK PHASE 3 TASK AS DONE**

```python
mcp__hephaestus__update_task_status({
    "task_id": "[your Phase 3 task ID]",
    "agent_id": "[YOUR ACTUAL AGENT ID]",
    "status": "done",
    "summary": f"SUCCESS! All tests pass. Resolved tickets {approach_ticket_id} and {main_issue_ticket_id}. Result submitted."
})
```

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PATH B: TESTS FAIL → APPROACH FAILED ❌
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**STEP 3B: MARK APPROACH AS FAILED**

```python
mcp__hephaestus__change_ticket_status({
    "ticket_id": approach_ticket_id,
    "agent_id": "[YOUR ACTUAL AGENT ID]",
    "new_status": "approach-failed",
    "comment": (
        "❌ APPROACH FAILED - Tests did not pass.\\n"
        "\\n"
        "**Test Results:**\\n"
        f"- Total tests: {total_tests}\\n"
        f"- Passed: {passed_tests}\\n"
        f"- Failed: {failed_tests}\\n"
        "\\n"
        "**Failing Tests:**\\n"
        "- {test_1}: {failure_reason}\\n"
        "- {test_2}: {failure_reason}\\n"
        "\\n"
        "**What Went Wrong:**\\n"
        "[Analysis of why tests failed]\\n"
        "\\n"
        "**Regression Analysis:**\\n"
        "[Did the fix break existing functionality?]\\n"
        "\\n"
        "**What This Tells Us:**\\n"
        "[Key learnings from this failed approach]\\n"
        "\\n"
        "**Recommendation:**\\n"
        "Need different approach. The fix may need to [suggestion]."
    )
})
```

**STEP 4B: UPDATE MAIN ISSUE TICKET**

```python
mcp__hephaestus__add_ticket_comment({
    "ticket_id": main_issue_ticket_id,
    "agent_id": "[YOUR ACTUAL AGENT ID]",
    "comment_text": (
        f"Approach {approach_ticket_id} failed comprehensive testing.\\n"
        "\\n"
        f"{failed_tests} tests failed. Need to explore alternative approaches.\\n"
        "\\n"
        "See approach ticket for detailed test results and analysis."
    )
})

# Note: Main issue ticket stays in 'exploring' status
# Do NOT resolve it - other approaches may still work
```

**STEP 5B: SAVE FAILURE LEARNINGS**

```python
mcp__hephaestus__save_memory({
    "agent_id": "[YOUR ACTUAL AGENT ID]",
    "content": (
        f"Approach {approach_ticket_id} failed testing. "
        f"{failed_tests} tests failed: {test_names}. "
        f"Learned: {key_learning}. "
        "Recommendation: {alternative_suggestion}."
    ),
    "memory_type": "error_fix"
})
```

**STEP 6B: CREATE NEW APPROACH TO CONTINUE**

🚨🚨🚨 CRITICAL: YOU MUST CREATE A NEW APPROACH - THIS IS NOT OPTIONAL! 🚨🚨🚨

```python
# 🔄 MANDATORY: CREATE A NEW APPROACH TO KEEP WORKFLOW MOVING!
# Tests failed, but we learned what doesn't work - use that to try something different!
# YOU CANNOT JUST MARK AS FAILED AND STOP - YOU MUST CREATE A NEW APPROACH!

# Create NEW approach ticket based on test failures
new_approach_ticket = mcp__hephaestus__create_ticket({
    "agent_id": "[YOUR ACTUAL AGENT ID]",
    "title": f"Approach: [NEW strategy based on test failures of {approach_ticket_id}]",
    "description": (
        f"## New Approach (After {approach_ticket_id} Failed Testing)\\n\\n"
        "### What We Learned from Test Failures\\n"
        "[What the test failures revealed - which tests failed and why]\\n\\n"
        "### New Strategy\\n"
        "[Different approach that addresses the test failure insights]\\n\\n"
        "### Why This Might Work\\n"
        "[Hypothesis based on understanding test failures]\\n\\n"
        "### Investigation Areas\\n"
        "- What to investigate differently based on test results\\n"
        "- Files/functions that tests showed are problematic\\n\\n"
        f"### Previous Failed Approach\\n"
        f"Testing of {approach_ticket_id} revealed: [key insights from failures].\\n"
        f"Parent issue: {main_issue_ticket_id}"
    ),
    "ticket_type": "approach",
    "priority": "medium",
    "tags": ["exploration", "retry-after-test-failure"],
    "parent_ticket_id": main_issue_ticket_id,
    "blocked_by_ticket_ids": [],
})
new_approach_id = new_approach_ticket["ticket_id"]

# Create NEW Phase 2 task
mcp__hephaestus__create_task({
    "description": f"Phase 2: Explore NEW approach - TICKET: {new_approach_id}. Previous approach {approach_ticket_id} failed testing with {failed_tests} test failures. Use those insights to investigate this different strategy.",
    "done_definition": f"New approach investigated based on test failure insights, ticket {new_approach_id} validated or failed, Phase 3 task created if valid OR another new approach created if failed.",
    "agent_id": "[YOUR ACTUAL AGENT ID]",
    "phase_id": 2,
    "priority": "medium",
    "cwd": ".",
    "ticket_id": new_approach_id
})

print(f"✅ Created new approach ticket {new_approach_id} and Phase 2 task based on test failure learnings!")
```

**STEP 7B: MARK PHASE 3 TASK AS DONE**

🚨 REMINDER: You should have created a new approach in STEP 6B above! 🚨

```python
mcp__hephaestus__update_task_status({
    "task_id": "[your Phase 3 task ID]",
    "agent_id": "[YOUR ACTUAL AGENT ID]",
    "status": "done",
    "summary": f"Comprehensive testing failed. {failed_tests} tests failed. Approach {approach_ticket_id} marked as failed with detailed analysis. Created new approach {new_approach_id} to continue exploration."
})
```

**STEP 8B: (OPTIONAL) CREATE ADDITIONAL EXPLORATION TASKS IF NEEDED**

If all explored approaches have failed, you might want to create new Phase 2 tasks:

```python
# Only if you have specific new ideas for different approaches
new_approach_ticket = mcp__hephaestus__create_ticket({
    "agent_id": "[YOUR ACTUAL AGENT ID]",
    "title": "Approach X: Try fixing via [new strategy based on learnings]",
    "description": "[Based on what you learned from failures]",
    "ticket_type": "approach",
    "priority": "medium",
    "parent_ticket_id": main_issue_ticket_id,
    "tags": ["exploration", "approach-x", "retry"]
})

mcp__hephaestus__create_task({
    "description": f"Phase 2: Explore new approach - TICKET: {new_approach_ticket['ticket_id']}...",
    "done_definition": "...",
    "agent_id": "[YOUR ACTUAL AGENT ID]",
    "phase_id": 2,
    "priority": "medium",
    "ticket_id": new_approach_ticket["ticket_id"]
})
```

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
TESTING CHECKLIST
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Run these tests:

1. **Reproduction Test**
   - Run the reproduction script from Phase 1
   - Should now pass (issue is fixed)

2. **Full Test Suite**
   - Run ALL tests in the project
   - Command varies by project (pytest, tox, make test, etc.)
   - Document the exact command used

3. **Specific Issue Tests**
   - If issue mentions specific test files, run those
   - Verify they pass

4. **Code Quality**
   - Run linter (if project has one)
   - Run type checker (if applicable)
   - Ensure no new warnings/errors

5. **Regression Check**
   - Compare test results to baseline
   - Ensure no previously passing tests now fail

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

✅ DO:
- Extract approach ticket and main issue ticket
- Run FULL test suite (not just reproduction test)
- Document complete test results
- 🚨 VERIFY patch contains ZERO test file modifications before submitting
- Generate git patch if tests pass
- Create comprehensive solution_submission.md if tests pass
- Resolve BOTH approach ticket AND main issue ticket if tests pass
- Submit result if tests pass
- Mark approach as failed with detailed analysis if tests fail
- Update main issue ticket with failure info if tests fail
- Save learnings to memory
- Be thorough and strict with validation

❌ DO NOT:
- 🚨 INCLUDE TEST FILE CHANGES IN PATCH (tests/, test/, *_test.py) - INSTANT REJECTION!
- Skip running full test suite
- Submit result if any tests fail
- Resolve tickets if tests fail
- Trust partial test results
- Skip generating git patch
- Create incomplete solution documentation
- Forget to update both tickets (approach + main issue)
- Leave tickets unresolved if successful
- Create false positives (marking as success when tests fail)
- 🚨🚨🚨 MARK AS FAILED WITHOUT CREATING NEW APPROACH - YOU MUST CREATE NEW APPROACH! 🚨🚨🚨

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
TICKET LIFECYCLE IN PHASE 3
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SUCCESS PATH:
Approach Ticket: testing → solved (resolved)
Main Issue Ticket: exploring → solved (resolved)

FAILURE PATH:
Approach Ticket: testing → approach-failed
Main Issue Ticket: exploring (stays here, waiting for other approaches)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

REMEMBER: The goal is a production-ready patch that solves the exact
issue described without breaking anything else. Be thorough and strict.

If tests fail, it's better to honestly mark the approach as failed and
try a different strategy than to submit a broken solution.""",
